    "In this project, our goal is explore and analyze a data set from the Hacker News Site.  Hacker news was developed by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user's post tech stories and they are voted and commented by other users.  Hacker News is very popular among the tech community and startups.  Posts that make it to the top of their listings typically get hundreds of thousands of unique visits and views.\n",

Users submit Ask HN or Show HN posts to either ask the large Hacker News community a specific question or show the community a project, product or something interesting.  Following are examples of recent posts (March 2019):\n",

    "* Ask HN: Startup failed after years of work -- Can I even get a job now?\n",
    "* Show HN: A simple Prolog Interpreter written in a few lines of Python 3\n",

    "* Show HN: Is running a VM windows 10 on a Linux OS (Ubuntu) secure?\n",
